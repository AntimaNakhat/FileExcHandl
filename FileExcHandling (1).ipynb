    "\n",
    "Scenario: When you need to share data between tasks quickly and efficiently, and the overhead of inter-process communication (IPC) would be too high.\n",

    "Multiprocessing is a technique that allows a program to execute multiple processes concurrently. Each process runs independently with its own memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallelism: Utilizes multiple CPU cores to execute tasks simultaneously, speeding up CPU-bound operations and enhancing performance.\n",
    "- Isolation: Ensures that processes run in separate memory spaces, so issues in one process (like crashes or memory leaks) do not affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Used in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Python’s GIL limits the execution of multiple threads in a single process, making multithreading less effective for CPU-bound tasks. Multiprocessing bypasses this limitation by using separate processes.\n",
    "- Improved Performance: Enables true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, such as data processing or computationally intensive operations.\n",
    "- Fault Tolerance: Isolates processes to prevent failures from propagating, thus increasing the robustness of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- multiprocessing Module: Provides classes and functions to create and manage processes, such as Process, Queue, and Pool.\n",
    "- Process Creation: Each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, allowing independent execution and avoiding GIL restrictions.\n",
